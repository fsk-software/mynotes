# MyNotes

This is a project that I use to play around with things in Android.  It is simple enough that I
bypassed the repository/interactor/domain layer.   In a more complex app, these layers would exist,
but they were massive overkill here since there are only 2 bits of data (notes and color filter) and no 
complex behavior.
